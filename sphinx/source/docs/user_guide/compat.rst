Leveraging Other Libraries
==========================

Overview
--------

Bokeh currently utilizes the third party library `mplexporter`_ to help convert
`Matplotlib`_ plots into Bokeh plots. MPL plots using features not supported
by `mplexporter`_ may not render fully. However, there are plans (`MEP 25`_)
for Matplotlib to adopt a native JSON ingest/export functionality of its own
in the future. This will allow Bokeh and other systems to interact more
robustly with Matplotlib.

Current MPL compatibility also is sufficient to render many instances of
`Seaborn`_ and `ggplot.py`_ code. Additionally you can easily render plots
generated by `Pandas`_ as well. To display any of these plots, pass them to
the ``bokeh.mpl.to_bokeh`` function:

----

.. autofunction:: bokeh.mpl.to_bokeh

You can see examples of Bokeh rendering plots from all of these libraries in the
`examples/compat`_ directory. This link points to master, don't forget to make
sure you're looking at examples that match with the version of bokeh you're
using.
